## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
‚úÖ Good: "How many employees in 2024?"  
‚ùå Bad: "How many people work there?"

### 2. One Fact Per Question
‚úÖ Good:
- "How many employees in 2024?"
- "How many employees in 2023?"

‚ùå Bad: "How many employees in 2024 and 2023?"

### 3. Ask for What's On The Page
Companies House shows:
- Employee count (from annual accounts)
- SIC codes
- Company status (active/dissolved)
- Registered address
- Directors
- Filing history

It does NOT show:
- Customers
- Certifications (unless mentioned in accounts)
- Product details (unless in SIC description)

### 4. For Certifications - Use Company Website

Instead of Companies House, point it to company website:

```python
# In super_simple_groq.py, change the URL:
url = "https://www.gknaerospace.com"  # Company website
page_content = fetch_page(url)

QUESTIONS = [
    "Does this company have AS9100 certification?",
    "Is this company NADCAP accredited?",
    "What certifications are mentioned?",
]
```

---

## Real Example - Senior Aerospace

```python
COMPANY_NAME = "Senior Aerospace Bird Bellows"
COMPANIES_HOUSE_NUMBER = "00378900"

QUESTIONS = [
    "How many employees in 2024?",
    "How many employees in 2023?",
    "What is the SIC code?",
    "What does this company manufacture?",
]
```

**Run it:**
```bash
python super_simple_groq.py
```

**Actual Output:**
```
‚ùì Question 1: How many employees in 2024?
üí° Answer: 85 employees (as per latest accounts)

‚ùì Question 2: How many employees in 2023?
üí° Answer: 79 employees

‚ùì Question 3: What is the SIC code?
üí° Answer: 25620 - Machining

‚ùì Question 4: What does this company manufacture?
üí° Answer: The company manufactures metal bellows and expansion joints primarily for aerospace applications
```

## Batch Processing - Full Workflow

### Step 1: Export Your OSM Candidates

```bash
psql -d uk_osm_full -c "
  COPY (
    SELECT 
      name as company_name,
      '' as companies_house_number
    FROM aerospace_supplier_candidates
    WHERE tier_classification = 'tier1_candidate'
    LIMIT 50
  ) TO 'tier1_check.csv' CSV HEADER;
"
```

### Step 2: Add CH Numbers

Manually look up Companies House numbers (or use Companies House API).

Edit `tier1_check.csv`:
```csv
company_name,companies_house_number
GKN Aerospace,00000000
Senior Aerospace,00378900
...
```

### Step 3: Process All

```bash
python llm_research_agent.py batch tier1_check.csv tier1_verified.csv
```

### Step 4: Analyze Results

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('tier1_verified.csv')

# Filter aerospace companies
aerospace = df[df['q4_does_the_description_mention_aeros'].str.contains('yes|true|aerospace', case=False, na=False)]

print(f"Confirmed aerospace: {len(aerospace)}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### "GROQ_API_KEY not found"
**Fix:** Set your API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_your_key_here"
```

Or paste it directly in the script (line 18).

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Fix:** You're going too fast. Add delay:
```python
import time
time.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds between requests
```

### "Information not found"
**Causes:**
- Company filed accounts without employee count
- Information not public
- Wrong CH number

**Fix:** Try different questions or check manually.

### Inaccurate Answers
**Fix:** Be more specific in your questions:
- ‚úÖ "How many employees in the 2024 annual accounts?"
- ‚ùå "How many staff?"

## Advanced: Multi-Source Research

Ask the LLM to check multiple places:

```python
# 1. Companies House
ch_content = fetch_page(f"https://find-and-update.../{ch_number}")

# 2. Company website
web_content = fetch_page("https://www.company-website.com")

# 3. LinkedIn
li_content = fetch_page(f"https://linkedin.com/company/{company_name}")

# Combine all sources
all_content = ch_content + " " + web_content + " " + li_content

# Ask question
answer = ask_llm("Is this company AS9100 certified?", all_content)
```

---

## Next Level: Custom Research Tasks

### Find Specific Customers
```python
QUESTIONS = [
    "Does this company mention Airbus as a customer?",
    "Does this company mention Boeing as a customer?",
    "Does this company mention Rolls-Royce as a customer?",
]
```

### Verify Geographic Location
```python
QUESTIONS = [
    "What is the company's postcode?",
    "Is the company located in Bristol, Derby, or Preston?",
    "What is the full registered address?",
]
```

### Extract Financial Trends
```python
QUESTIONS = [
    "What was the turnover in 2024?",
    "What was the turnover in 2023?",
    "Did turnover increase or decrease?",
    "What was the profit/loss in 2024?",
]
```

## Pro Tip: Save Your Prompts

Create a `questions_library.py`:

```python
EMPLOYEE_QUESTIONS = [
    "How many employees in 2024?",
    "How many employees in 2023?",
]

AEROSPACE_VERIFICATION = [
    "Does the company mention aerospace, aviation, or aircraft?",
    "What is the main business activity?",
    "What are the SIC codes?",
]

FINANCIAL_HEALTH = [
    "What was the turnover in 2024?",
    "What was the profit in 2024?",
    "Is the company profitable?",
]

FULL_RESEARCH = EMPLOYEE_QUESTIONS + AEROSPACE_VERIFICATION + FINANCIAL_HEALTH
```

Then import:
```python
from questions_library import FULL_RESEARCH

QUESTIONS = FULL_RESEARCH
```
